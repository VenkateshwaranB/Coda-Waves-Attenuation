# Coda-Waves-Attenuation
The attenuation coda waves has been estimated using single backscattering method. The frequency dependency relation of attenuation has been determined by quality factor with their lapse times. These datasets incorporate with the central parts of japan seismological activity. its characterized by high and low seismic attenuation.
